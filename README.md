**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL2. The installer handles everything — Python, Node.js, dependencies, and the `hermes` command. No prerequisites except git.

> **Windows:** Native Windows is not supported. Please install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and run the command above.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes              # start chatting!
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `hermes` | Run `hermes gateway setup` + `hermes gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Self-hosted Provider Recipes (`examples/lunark/`)

End-to-end recipes for running Hermes against a self-hosted vLLM
gateway, validated continuously against the live `lunark` cluster.
Use these as a starting point for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
(local llama.cpp, hosted vLLM, MosaicML, etc.).

| Recipe | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`provision.py`](examples/lunark/provision.py) | Read `<base_url>/models` and write isolated `HERMES_HOME` profiles per model. Idempotent — rerun on lineup changes. Defaults to `~/.hermes/profiles/` so the profiles survive reboot. |
| [`extractor.py`](examples/lunark/extractor.py) | Robust answer extraction (LaTeX `\frac`/`\boxed`, decimals ↔ fractions, English number words, yes/no with negation). Used by every verifier-style runner. |
| [`batch_qa.py`](examples/lunark/batch_qa.py) | 100-prompt single-model baseline across 10 categories (math/logic/code/translate/format/text/stepwise/compare/creative/knowledge). |
| [`matrix.py`](examples/lunark/matrix.py) | 4 models × 100 prompts = 400 ACP calls via 8-worker pool. |
| [`tool_calls.py`](examples/lunark/tool_calls.py) | 10 tool-using scenarios per model. Validates that the `tool_calling: true` advertisement in `/v1/models` is real. |
| [`moa.py`](examples/lunark/moa.py) / [`moa_hard.py`](examples/lunark/moa_hard.py) / [`moa_aggregator.py`](examples/lunark/moa_aggregator.py) | Three Mixture-of-Agents flavors: simple majority vote, weighted vote, and the paper-style 3-reference + 1-aggregator architecture. |
| [`variance.py`](examples/lunark/variance.py) | 5-run variance measurement on the 100-prompt set — produces per-model `mean ± stdev` so single-shot accuracy isn't trusted blindly. |
| [`use_cases.py`](examples/lunark/use_cases.py) | 50 practical use cases across 10 industry categories, each routed to the most appropriate model. |
| [`advanced.py`](examples/lunark/advanced.py) | ACP advanced features: multi-turn coherence, `session/list`, `session/fork` divergence, `session/cancel` mid-stream. Raw JSON-RPC. |

See [`examples/lunark/README.md`](examples/lunark/README.md) for the
quickstart and a summary of lessons learned (including measured pitfalls
like `tool_calling: true` advertisements that don't actually work for
some models, and the trade-off between mode=all and mode=topk skill
injection — see `skills.retrieval` config below).

---

## Optional config blocks (recent additions)

```yaml
# Drop tool definitions when /v1/models advertises tool_calling: false.
# Auto-detected per model; no config required to enable. See P1 commit.

# Top-k skill retrieval — bound system-prompt token cost when many
# user/agent skills accumulate. Off by default (mode: all) for full
# backward compat.
skills:
  retrieval:
    mode: topk          # default "all" preserves the old "inject all"
    top_k: 3
    min_score: 0.05

# Mixture-of-Agents tool: point at any OpenAI-compatible provider.
# Default is OpenRouter (the original behavior).
moa:
  provider: custom
  base_url: https://llm.lunark.ai/v1
  api_key_env: LUNARK_API_KEY
  reference_models:
    - Qwen3.5-27B
    - Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
    - Gemma-4-31B-it
  aggregator_model: Qwen3-32B
```

`hermes insights` now also surfaces a `🌱 Self-Learning` panel showing
how many user/agent skills have been created in the last 30 days, the
top-used skills (with invocation counts), and any unused skills — so
the loop's effect is visible instead of opaque.

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
